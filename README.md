# UIColor-HexString
Easy, Android-compatible hex strings to UIColor. Code from Micah Hainline, found on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1560081/how-can-i-create-a-uicolor-from-a-hex-string/7180905#7180905. All I've done is package it for CocoaPods.

Example:

    [UIColor colorWithHexString:@"#2D9EDF"]
    
Or, in Swift:
    
    UIColor.init(hexString:"#2D9EDF")

Has support for the following hex formats:

- #RGB
- #ARGB
- #RRGGBB
- #AARRGGBB
